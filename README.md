🌍 Atliq Hardware's Global Expansion: Insights from Data-Driven Decision Making 🌍

As Atliq expands its hardware business across the globe, navigating challenges such as significant losses in Latin America has highlighted the importance of data-driven decision-making. With vast amounts of data to analyze, from team performances to customer, region, and product-level insights, I had the opportunity to work on a complex Power BI project that showcased the true potential of data analytics.

🚀 Key Views Developed:
📊 Finance View: Focused on profit & loss (P&L) across regions, markets, customers, and products. KPIs included Net Sales, Gross Margin %, and Net Profit %, with insights into YTD and YTG performance.
💼 Sales View: Analyzing customer performance, product-level net sales, and gross margins. KPIs: Gross Margin, Net Sales, and Gross Margin %.
📈 Marketing View: Highlighted product performance at regional and country levels, focusing on Net Profit %, Gross Margin, and Net Sales.
📦 Supply Chain View: Ensured optimal stock levels with KPIs like Forecast Accuracy, Net Error, and Abs Error.
🌍 Market Share View: Presented top management with insights into Atliq Hardware's market share, revenue returns, and top 5 customers/products.

🔧 Technical Insights:

Connected MySQL databases to Power BI
Explored data using SQL
Designed a snowflake schema data model and optimized it with DAX Studio
Developed a strong understanding of OLTP/OLAP systems, data warehousing, and the importance of a date table
Refined my skills in DAX and Power BI design
Added functionalities like last refresh data and analyzed report data with Excel
But more than the technical skills, I gained a deeper understanding of how a hardware company operates, and how P&L values can make or break a business.
